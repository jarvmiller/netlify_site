## Hey, I'm Jarvis Miller


I am now a first year Statistics PhD student at University of Michigan. I'm a relatively new addict to all things Data Science and making sure that what I do is computationally feasible and able to be interpreted by a non-technical body.
While being buried in homework, I try to take online courses related to computing and attempt small projects like this blog to put things into practice.
My research interests are pretty vague at this moment, but I'm learning towards something related to infectious disease modeling. I hope to work with disease genotype data and get more involved with making packages and high performance computing.

**All in all, I'm passionate about data visualization and making complex things easier to digest.**
