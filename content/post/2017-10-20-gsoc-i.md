This summer I'll be working on implementing Survey Methods in StatsModels thanks to [Google Summer of Code (GSOC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). I'm excited because I took my first official programming course last semester (C++ seems to stand strong against the test of time) and get to learn more about open source software development. 

I still remember the first programming course I signed up for during my freshman year at Rice. I dropped after the first week. It seems so foreign and of course because it was entry level, I was surrounded by people who have already taken AP computer science or used online resources to gain experience beforehand. I got scared and due to the large class size, I don't think anyone had to time or energy to even notice I dropped out, let alone try to talk with me through it. Now, I get to contribute to StatsModels and scientist everywhere who need to use survey methods for their data. 

I can't lie, I'm not as prepared as I should be... but that's only involving technical experience. I can learn how to write unit tests, read and understand survey methods along the way, etc.. I have a great mentor, Kerby Shedden, and I'm prepared to work my butt off. My next update will probably come around the second week of June. This month will be spent studying for my qualification exam. :'(
